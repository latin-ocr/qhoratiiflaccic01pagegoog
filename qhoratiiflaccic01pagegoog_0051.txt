ODE 11.

. This ode is addressed to Augustus as the almost divine pro-
tector and guar-'dian of the Roman state. It commences with
an account of the portents which indicated the wrath of
the gods at the murder of Caesar (on the Ides of March
ne. 44)' 1- 20, alludes to the civil war which followed 20-
24, asks to what god the duty of expiating the guilt of
‘Rome shall be assigned, and finally gives the preference to
Mercury, who (line 40) is supposed to take upon him the form
of Augustus. The ode concludes with a prayer that Augustus
may long live to guide and guard the state.

The mention of may—nos triumphos in line 49 and the nature
of the ode suggest the year 29 13.c. as the date of its compo-
sition. In that year Augustus returned to Rome as sole master of
the Rotnan world, and on the 7 th and following days of Sextilis
(thereafter called Augustus) celebrated his triple triumph over
thelgalmatians, over Cleopatra at Actium, and over the Alex-
an ans.

The whole ode is to be compared with the brilliant passage
of Virgil, Georg. 1. 465 to the end, and the description of the
portents with Shakespeare‚ Jul. Caes. Act i. sc. 3. -
