the appreciation and understanding of their reference
to and bearing on the whole Ode in which they are
contained. In these Notes an attempt has been made
'to afford materials for this complete and full under-

Stanghngthe other hand, as this is a school book, no
pains have been taken to accumulate references or

⁷ illustrations in large numbers, nor have varieties of

readings or points of technical scholarship and rival
interpretation been discussed‚ except in some few
instances (e. g. in the notes on 2. 14 and the whole
of Ode 28) where the points were of general interest
and dependent for their solution rather on the pos-
session of common sense than of exceptional learning.
, Two editions I have had principally before me,
¹and not unfrequently referred to; the large edition
of Orelli because it is without a rival as an edition of
Horace, and that of Mr Wickham because the tact
and discrimination with which the notes are selected
and arranged and the exceptional merit of the Intro—
ductions will always make it a favourite even with
others than those who fear to face Orelli. The bulk
of my notes however are the result of a long admiration
for Horace, and have been written down without
reference to any books whatever: my hope is that
they are such notes as a good teacher taking a 1633011
viva voce would wish to lay before his pupils so that
they might obtain an intelligent and thorough under-

standing of the author.
