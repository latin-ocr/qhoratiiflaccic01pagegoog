ODE XXXV.

⁸ Ο Queen of Antium, thou all-powerful goddess Fortune,
thee the poor man supplicates and 1116 661161, ‘thee the nations
worship, and the mothers of princes and even kings =in all
their glory fearful lest thou shouldest overthrow their pros-
perity. Before thee marches Destiny with 611 1116 symbols
of her immutable power: with thee are Hope and Good Faith,
faithful, even when thou hast ceased to smile and the vulgar
herd of flatterers has deserted the unfortunate. Ο (16 thou
guard the Emperor in his attack on Britain and our armies
in the East: may ’111666 legitimate wars expiate om· unholy
civil contentione, may Roman swords no longer be whetted
but against a foreign foe? v

The Fortune of this Ode is not a fickle and capricious
goddess3 not as od. 3. 29. 49,

Fortuna saevo laeta neyotio et
ψ ludum insolentem ludere pertinax,

but symbolizes that unknown mysterious power which regulates
at will the changeful phases of human life. At line 29 this
general conception is specialized and the prayer is addressed
16 11161 Fortuna populi Romani of whose power 1116 Romans
were strongly reminded whenever they recalled 1116 history
of the growth of their world· wide empire.

Wickham aptly quotes and 116 ppily renders Plutarch’ 6
description of this Fortune ((16 Fortuna Romanorum, c. 4)‚‘ even
as Aphrodite, when she crossed the Ε1116166,161’(1 asido her
mirror and her ornaments and her cestus, ami took spear and
shield to adorn herself for Lycurgus’ eyes, so when, after
her sojourning with Persians and Assyrians, with Macedonians

and Carthaginiens, she (Τύχη) approached the Palatino and
crossed the 'siben she laid. asido her wings and took off

her sandals and lof’t behind her her ball, 1116 symbol of fickle-
11666 and change?
