15. cunque] There is no other instance of the nse of-
this word. All the MSS. give it here. It seems to have the
same sense as in quandocunque, and to make the ‘notion of
time contained in the tempora] participle vocanti indefinite.
Vocanltgblcunque = whenever 1 call. It is however a very
remar e use. -

‘Iset not the memory of Glycera’e cruelty grieve you too ’
much, Tibullus, and cease lamenting that you are outshone by
a rival. It is a common case: Lycoris loves Cyrus, cyrus
loves Pholoe, and Pholoe thinks Cyrus detestable. Venus
loves in cruel sport to yoke together those who will never
make a pair. The very same thing has happened to myselr.
as to you?

For the intimacy of Horace and Tibullus (for whom see
Classe. Dict.) see caremny Epist. 1. 4, Albi, ‘nostrorum samonum
candide judeae, and the panegyric which follows. 'tibanus’
poetry is full of the plaintive laments referred to inl. 2.

1. plus nimo] cf. 18. 15. The phrase is put between
doleas and memor that it may go partly with both.

2. immitis Glycerae] Notice the play of words: immitis
:bitter, and γλυκερὰεειποοίῑ. Of. dulce loquens Lalage (λα-

λεῖν), 22. 24. Such plays on words are especially frequent in
tragedy, cf. Aiax 430,

αἰαῖ· τίς ἄν ποτ’ ᾤεθ’ ᾧὸ ἐπώνυμον
τούμὸν ξυνοίσειν ὄνομα, τοῖς ἐμοῖς κακοΐςς
