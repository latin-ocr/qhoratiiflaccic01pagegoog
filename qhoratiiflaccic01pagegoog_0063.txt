ODE VI.

‘Your exploits‚ Agrippa, would be a worthy theme for Varius :
· his poetry is Homeric.1 am not capable of treating a subject
811011 as that' of the Iliad or Odyssey: 0110 of my poor odes would
bnt detract from your fame. Love and levity alone befit my
inconstant muse?

written about by Varius. ' Others read aliti, but this use of the
dative, though common enough with the perfect passive, e. g.

1. scriberis] A peculiarly Horatian use of the future.
‘Yon will be written of,' i e. if you will take my advice. So
Ode 7.1, laudabunt alii—others shall Praise, i. e. if they wish3
Ode 20. 1, vile potabis—you shall drink, i. e. if you will accept
my invitation.
