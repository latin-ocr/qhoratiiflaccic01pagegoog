ODE XVI.

⁸ Fair lady, do what you choose with my scurrilous verses z
they were written in 9 passion, and passion is ungovernable.
Prometheus in making man 19 said to have added, among
other qualities, a portion of the wrath of the lion. Pession
has ever proved 19111099. Ι too was urged by it to make my

libellous attacks, which 1 am now 99391 10 recantl

This ode is 9 παλινῳδία or 190991911011.Τ119 most famous
palinode 19 1119 0119 referred 10 by Horace Epod. 17. 42,

infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice
fraterque mamni Castoris victi prece
adempta miti reddidere lumina.

It was written by Stesichorus when deprived of 1119 913111
for libelling Η91911; 11 was certainly thorough enough, for
it begins by denyin gthat Helen ever went 10 Troy (Plat.

Phaedr. 243 y.A)
Whether the criminosi iambi are to be found in the ex-

19111 writings of Horace or 1101 19 a question 11191 0911 never
be settled, and will probably therefore be always debated.

Epodes 5 and 17 are most frequently referred 10.

3. pones] 2nd pers. fut. for 9 polite imperative. ponere
modum: to put 9 limit to them, i. 9. destroy them. There
19 9190 a suggestion that the iambics had been without modus,

limit, measure, moderation.

lambis] Archilochus is said to have invented the iambic,
and to have employed it in his well- known lampeons. cf.

Hor. A. P. 79, Archilochum proprio rabies armavit iambo.
⁹ Hence iambics 1)9091119 1119011 used in such scurrilous poetry,
for which indeed they are admirably adap ted, the iambic being

99 little 99 possible removed from thep 19939939 01 ordinary
life and conversation.
