94 ΗΟΒΑΟΕ, ODES I. xxviii.

Horace is to blame for it. The Ode is 'distinctly faulty: an
ode to which no two people attach the same meaning is self-
condemned. It is needless to say that its defects have made

it ’extremely well known, and it is a great favourite with exa·
mmers.

Ι have judged best to append (1) a close literal translation,

(2) an explanation of allusions, διο. (3) a short statement of
the chief theories about the ode.

‘ Thee, Archytas», who didst measure the sea and earth and
innumerable sand the petty gift of a little dust by the Matine
shore confines, nor does it aught avail thee to have attempted
the dwellings of the sky, and in thought to have sped through
the vault of heaven, since thou wert to die after all. Perished

refuse to bestow a particle of shifting sand on my bones and
unburied head: so, whatever Eurus shall threaten against the
Italian waves‚ may the woods of Venusium be lashed and thou

on thee from favouring Jupiter and Neptune, guardian of
sacred Tarentum. Do you dcem it a light thing to commit a
crime which will hereafter bring injury upon your innocent
children? Nay‚ haply even on thyself awaiteth the debt of
justice and haughty retribution: I will not be left with my
curses unavenged‚ and thee no expiatory sacrifices shall free.
However hurried thou art, 'tis but a brief delay: cast but
