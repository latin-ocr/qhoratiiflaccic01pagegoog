ODE XXIV.

· Probably addressed to virgil by Horace on the unexpeoted
death of their common friend Quinctilius Varus. Virgil’s grief
seems to have been excessivo. Horaee's consolatione partake
of the nature of those eommonplaoes referred to by Tennyson,
In Memoriam, canto 6, but they are expressed in language οε
singular beauty.

Of Quinctilius (probably Quinctilius Varus, of. 18. 1) our
chief knowledge is that he died in 13.0. 24, and was a native
of Cremona, but his name is, like a fiy in. umber, enshrined
in this Ode for immortality.
