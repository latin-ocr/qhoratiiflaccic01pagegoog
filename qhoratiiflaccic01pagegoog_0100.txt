Notioe what Prof. Mayor calls ‘the ‹zo-ordination of eon-
trasted elauses’ in qaudeat and dedicet .- in English we should
insert ‘but,’ the Romans however love to set the contrasted
clauses side by side without any adversative particle. The
Greeks would use μέν and δέ.

ODE XXVI.

‘ I am the friend of the muses, and therefore will throw
sorrow and anxiety to the winde, utterly untroubled by the
⁸ Eastern question.' Help me rather, O Muse, to weave a
ehaplet of verse for Lamia, for he is worthy.'

Lamia is also mentioned 36. '73 he is generally supposed
to be L. Aelius Lamia, who was praefectus urbi ΑΔ). 32, and
must have been very young when Horace wrote: from the
very slight and unimportant nature of the Ode it is possible
he was so, ·

The date is approximately determined 'by the politieal
allusion. Wiokham in his introduction says: ‘ Phraates IV.
·to whom Orodes Ι. had resigned his throne in B.c. 38, after
some years of tyranny, provoked his subjeets to the point of
rebellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates, another member
of the Arsaoid house, was put on the throne in his place. After
a short time Phraates was restored (J ustinus adds by the
intervention of the Scythiam), and Tiridates fied to seek the
protestion of Augustus,’ of. Odes 2. 2. 17, and 3. 8. 19.
nc. 30 is the probable date of this event.

“’ 2, 3. tradam ventis portare] ‘ 1 wiH give to the winde to

carry.' The infinitivo seems epexegetie or complementary,
further defining the phrase tradam ventis. The gerundive eon-
struotion would be found in prose: ef. virg. Aen. 1. 319,
dederatque comam dtffundere ventis. From 2. 8 and 12. 3 we·
see how fond Horace is of peculiar uses of the infinit-ive.

3. quis sub Arete...] Notioe that sub Arcto does not go
with quie (dat. plural) or metuatur, but with rex yelidae orae.
