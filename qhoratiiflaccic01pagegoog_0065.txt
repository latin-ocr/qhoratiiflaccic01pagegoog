· , proella...] ‘combats of maidens fiercely attacking· the young
men (acrium in juvenes) with pared nails' (i. e. not wishing to

dangerous). Wickham aptly remarks ‘who shall decide P ’

19. vacui] i. e. eive vacui. Cf. 1. 3. 16. Translatet ‘whether
fancy-free, or fired by a spark of love, easy as is my wont.'

ODE VII.

‘Many fair and favourite places are there on earth, none
- that 1 love so fondly as Tibur. Do you Plancus, whether as now
in camp or, as you will be soon, we trust, at Tibur, remember
,that it is occasionally true philosophy to forget care in wine?
‚Think of the example of Teucer in his troubles.’

L. Munatius Plancus (Le. splay·footed), consul 13.c. 42 and
founder of Lugdunum (Lyons), an accomplished trimmer
during the· civil wars, who however seems to have enjoyed con-
siderable favour or influence with Octavian, who received the
title of Augustus on his proposal Β.- c. 2¹7.

At this time he seems to have been suffering from melan-
choly and a desire to quit Italy. By his use of tenebit, in con-
trast to tenent in line 20, Horace really addresses an invitation
‘to Plancus to come to Tibur, of which he has already sung the
'pr-aises, This may seem to lay too much stress on tenent ex·
cept to those who recollect that Horace is very fond of this use
of the future, that he would certainly not use tenebit after
„tenent without a definite object, and that he wishes to suggest
such a residence rather than openly propose it. Moreover this
seerlrlts thie only way of connecting the earlier and later portione

1. laudabunt] Cf. Od- 6. 1‚=‘others shall praise’ (for all
ἼΙ care), i. e. let others praise. “

· 2. bimaris] The two harbours of Corinth, Lechaeum on
qt‘lgeoffonic· Gulf, Cenchreae on the Orissaean Gulf, are well

, 4. Tempe] Notice Tempe, neuter plural, like τἐίχη.
