ODE XXXI.

In nc. 28 Augustus, in memory of the victory of Actium,
dedicated a temple to Apollo on the Palatino, and at the same
time a library which contained not only the works but the
busts of eminent Greek and Roman writers. This latter
circumstance naturally caused considerable excitement and
emulation in the literary world, and is continually referred to
gy th2eg3n. Of. Epist. 2. 1. 216, 2. 2. 94, 1. 3. 17, and Suet.

⁴ What shall the poet pray for to his patron god Apollo on
this great day 2 Not for large estates and wealth. Let wealth
and luxurious living be for prosperous merchants who think
themselves the very favourites of heaven because their ships
have made many successful voyages. I am satisfied with simple
fare, and ask but for a healthy mind and healthy body, an
old age free from dishonour and charmed by poetry!

1. dedicatumJ= ‘in his new temple.’ The Romans can say
not merely dedicare aedem, but dedicare dmcm5 Wickham well
says, ‘ perhaps from the image of the god which was installed
in his shrine) In this case we know that there actually was
such an image, a statue by Scopas which Angustus brought
from Greece (Plin. 36. 5. 4). Propertius describes it (3. 23. 5),
and a copy of it, the ‘ Apollo citharoedus,' is in the Vatican‚
and is represented in Smith's Hist. of Greece, p. 551, 580.
