bestowed on the dead, a mistake of the sailor which Archytas
afterwards correcte. I cannot believe this. (2) What instance

is there of such a dialogue in any Ode of Horace? (Odes 3. 9

is not in point.) (3) What authority is there for the fact that
Archytas was drowned? cast ashore on the Matine beach? 1
and unburied? (4) Assuming that he was, why should Ho-

race write this curious Ode about a man he cared nothing 1
about, who had died 400 years before, and, according to aea
cepted theories (see Virg. Aen. 6. 329), would even if unburied
have completed his 100 years of wandering on the banks of
Styx 300 years before? (5) Is it natural to put the philoso-
phie reflectione of the opening lines in the mouth of a wan-
dering sailor ? ' .

'l'he simplest explanation seems to be, that there was at
any rate a so-called tomb of Archytas on that Matine shore
with which Horace from his boyhood would be well acquainted
(cf. ‘reference to Venusium 1. 26), and that he makes this the
dramatic scene of his ode, which is a monologue, the speaker
being the spirit of some traveller who had been shipwrecked
on the coast near Archytas' tomb and been left unburied. Ho-
race may actually have seen such a case. In this case the
argument would r'un thus, the opening reflections being sug-
gested by the proximity of the tomb. ‘Yes‚ we must all die!
Even for you, Archytas, six feet of earth must suffice. So it
has been even with the greatest: even your own highly ho·
noured teacher is dead. All end at the same goal, though they
reach it by different paths, some in war, others by shipwreck.
Ι too have been drowned: (then ,suddenly breaking off at the
thought of the sad fate of the unburied,) but do thou, O sailor
(any sailor who might be passing along the shore, or on the
sea close in), kindly perform for me the last offices: they wiu
not long delay you!

ODE XXIX.

’ ⁴ Are you really, IcciuS, intending to join the expedition to
Arabia? What can you hope to gain? Surely the world
must be upside down when the philosophie Iccius sells his

carefully formed library to buy armour.'

Iccius is also referred to Epist. 1. 12 as the steward of
Agrippa’s Sicilian estates. The expedition referred to is one
