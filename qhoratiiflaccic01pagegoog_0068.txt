ODE VHL

‘ Say, Lydia, why you cre so eager that your love should be
the ruin of Sybaris, by keeping him from all the manly exer·
cises in which he used to excel.’

1, 2. per te deos oro] :per deos te oro. 'I'he peculim·
order is idiomatic and usual. So too in Gk. Soph. Phil. 468,

πρὸς νῦν σε πατρὸς . . . . ἱκνοῦἱιαι.

2. Sybarin] A fit name for such a love-sick youth. ' For .

the history of the luxurious and effeminate town which has
provided us with the word ‘ sybarite' see Class. Dict.

properes] Some read properas, thus making this a direct
question 'instead of an indirect'one‚ subordinate to dic .· this
is however impossible, owing to the oderit which follows,
and which can scarcely ‚be anything but the subjunctive. Iu
l. 6 equitat is a direct question, because to continue with in-
direct ones would be wearisome.

3, 4. apricum campum] · On sunny afternoons the broad
ffoanlgg &12th2 ἓῃαέαξέιὲἕξὲἷῐωε was the regular resort of all

4. patiens] i.e. either by nature, or formerly.
6. aequales] 'I'hose of the same age, ὁμήλικες.

Gallica...] ‘nor guide the mouth of a Gaulish steed with*

jagged bit) Gaul-ish horses were celebrated. Lupatwt is an
adjective, but the plural lupata· or lupata is used for ‘ a bit.'
From the name which indicates an instrument furnished with
teeth like those of a wolf, and our knowledge of the Roman

character, we may infer how they treated their horses. The ·.

word temperat would be euphemistic.

8.. Rbenm] A plunge ⁴in the Tiber concluded the daily
exorciso.

olivum] oil‚ used by the wrestlers. oliva=the olive-trec:
os. Gk. ἔλαιον and ἐλαία.

lo. neque iam...] ⁴ And no longer has his arms black and
blue with (the use of) weapons, formerly illustrious for often
sending the discus and often the javelin clear beyond the
limit (attained by his rivale).’

mem] Frequentative, from aero = to wear: we cannot use ,

the ,expression in English, and it is rare in Latin.
