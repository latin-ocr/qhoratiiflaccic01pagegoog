17. te semper anteit...] Wickham gives a good summary
of Lessing's criticism on this passage. It is to the effect that
the poet has trespassed on the painter's art; a painter por·
traying Destiny would be compelled to shew who she was by
symbols, a poet has other and better ways. ³ Some imagine
that Horace was thinking of some actually existing picture
or representation, and indeed an ancient Etruscan miri-or
from Perugia exists representing Athrpa (=Atrop03, or Des-
tiny) in the act of fixing a nail with a hammer, symbolizing
an immutably fixed decision.

22. nec comitem abnegat] sc. se, ‘nor refuses her com·
panionship.' This stanza is without doubt awkwardly ex-
pressed. Horace says that ‘Faith accompanies Fortune when·
ever in changed attire (indicative of misfortune) she in hostile
mood quits a (formerly) power-ful mansion.' Now the phrase ‘to
follow, or accompany Fortune ’ always means to vary or change
in conduct according as Fortune changes: in fact we find in
Ov. Pont. 2. 3.· 7 the sarcastic remark,

et cum Fortuna statque caditque Fides,

and we say in English, ‘friends and fortune fly together ;”
‘but Horace means the exact opposite, he means that fidet
does not vary in calamity. What he intends to say is, ‘ w‘hefi
