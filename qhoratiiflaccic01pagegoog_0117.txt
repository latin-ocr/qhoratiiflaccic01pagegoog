A very interesting little Ode. Horace was at any rate fairly
acquainte'd with and disposed to favour the philosophy of Epi-
curus. That philosophy had lately been brilliantly described
in almost the grandest effert of Roman poetry, the De Rerum
Natura of Lueretius. One of its cardinal points was that either.
gods did not exist at all or that they lived wholly and entirely
gpffii a life remote from care (securum ωροτε aevum, Sat. 1.

Where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind

Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
Their sacred everlasting calml’

Taumsou’s Lueretius.

The Epicur-eane urged that many things, which the vulgat
believed to declare the presence of God, were but the results
of the ordinary action of independent natural forces. Among
many other arguments one of the most popular was: if thunder
be the voice of God, why does it never thunder except when
there are clouds about and it can therefore be explained on
natural grounds? cf. Arist. Nubes 370—430 and also Lucr.
Book 6, where the whole subject is discussed and the actual
question put (6. 400),

denique cur nunquam caelo jacit undique puro
Juppiter in terrae fulmen sonitusque profudit?

Horace had however actually heard thunder caelo puro .· he

cannot understand or account for it: it fiashes across him

sapientia is the. regular word for wisdom, meaning thereby
