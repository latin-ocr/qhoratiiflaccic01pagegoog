ODE XXXVII.

An Ode written on the arrival at Rome of the news of Cleo-
patra²s death, which was brought in the autumn of 13.o. 30 by
M. Tullius Cicer0, the son of the orator. No mention is made
of the death of M. Antonius, because the destruction of a Ro-
man citizen was no ground for exultatiom so in his triumph
on his return to Rome all allusion to the defeat and death of
Antony was carefully avoided by Augustus.

The Ode is probably one of Horace's earliest: in his later
odes he would not admit such lines as 5 and 14.

g For the bitter Roman hatred of Cleopatra see Propertius
4. 11 aley’s edition„ for the battle of Aetium Propertius 5.6,
and or. Ep. 9, and Virg. Aen. 8. 675. These passages are
all of the utmost interest but are too long to quote.

1. nunc est bibendum...] This commencement is copied
trom Alcaeus,

νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν
Πίνην ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.

2. pulsanda tellus] So of joyous dunning, Od. 3. 18. 15,
Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor ter pede terram.

Saliaribus] See last ode. For the luxury of priestly feasts
cf. too Od. 2. 14. 28, mero Pontificum potiore coenis. .

3. mimas] see niet, of Ant.

4. tempus erat] Orelli says, sactum illud Jamdudum opor.-
tebat atque etiam nuno oportet, i.e. ‘it was long since time, ' ‘how-
ever soon we begin it cannot be too early! He compares Arist..
Eocl. 87¹7, τί ποθ’ ἄνδρες οὐχ ἥκουσινς ὥρα δ’ ἦν πάλαι.

Wickham says: ‘ we were right to wait: this was the time!

Either explanation will satisfy tempus erat, but to my mind
Horace’s expression seems awkward. He does not merely say
tempus erat, which would be simple, but nune...tempue erat,
and that immediately after writing in an exactly similar sense
nune eat bibendum.

5. depromere] Some say that the de indicates ‘down,’the
apotheca or store-room for the wine being in the upper part.
