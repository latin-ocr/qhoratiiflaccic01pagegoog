poetry that it should be suggestive rather than de-
scriptive‚ fragmentary rather than continuone ¹, but
no true lyric poetry‚ certainly not the Odes of Horace,
can be fully understood without an endeavour to die-
cern the central thought which links together into a
living unity what are often apparently disunited and
disjointed sentences, It is hardly necessary however
to point out that this effort to obtain a general concep-
tion of a passage or poem as a whole is of primary
importance in the development of the intellectual
faculties, and the shortness of the Odes renders them
especially adapted for boys’ reading in this respect.
At the same time it is a curious fact that no lyric poet
has suffered more than Horace, from a want of effort
to thus estimate his Odes as each an individua] whole:
a hundred persons can quote separate sentences to one
who has a thorough conception of an entire Ode.
The fact is that Horace's felicity in expressing a single
thought is so unrivalled, he so abounds in those epi-

grammatic phrases,
‘ iewels five words long,

That on the stretched fore-finger of all time
Sparkle for ever,'

that those who appreciate his high poetic power to

this extent think that they have fathomed the secret

<gegis reputation because even when thus taken piece-
2

invenies etiam disjecti membra poetae.

But indeed it is impossible to form an adequate
conception of Horace without adding to the appre-
ciation and understanding of single words and phrases

¹ Any one who will consider the gaps which the reader has
to fin up in passing from one canto to another of In Memoriam
will find how much this is the case.
