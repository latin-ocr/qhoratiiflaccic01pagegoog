ODE' XXII.

⁸ 'l'he just and innocent need no protection, Fuscus, through
whatever dangers their path lesds them. At any rate 1 know
that a monstrous wolf did not attaek me while 1 was wandering
in the woods thinking of Lalage. In any elimate 1 shall feel
saie and eontentedly sing my lady’s oharmsss

Of Aristius Fuscus our prineipal knowledge is derived from
Horace, Ep. 1. 10. 3, where he says,
paene qemelli
fraternis animis, quidquid negat alter et alter,
annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi.

He seems to have been a man of studious testes, and dis-
tinguished as a eritis (grammaticus).
